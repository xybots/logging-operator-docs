## Getting Support

If you encounter any problems that the documentation does not address, [file an issue](https://github.com/banzaicloud/logging-operator/issues) or talk to us on the Banzai Cloud Slack channel [#logging-operator](https://slack.banzaicloud.io/).

[Commercial support]({{< relref "/docs/one-eye/logging-operator/_index.md#support">}}) is also available for the Logging operator.

Before asking for help, prepare the following information to make troubleshooting faster:

- Logging operator version
- kubernetes version
- helm/chart version (if you installed the Logging operator with helm)
- Logging operator logs
- [fluentd configuration]({{< relref "/docs/one-eye/logging-operator/operation/troubleshooting/fluentd.md#check-fluentd-configuration" >}})
- [fluentd logs]({{< relref "/docs/one-eye/logging-operator/operation/troubleshooting/fluentd.md#get-fluentd-logs" >}})
- [fluentbit configuration]({{< relref "/docs/one-eye/logging-operator/operation/troubleshooting/fluentbit.md#check-the-fluent-bit-configuration" >}})
- fluentbit logs

Do not forget to remove any sensitive information (for example, passwords and private keys) before sharing.
